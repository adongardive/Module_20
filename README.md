### **Project Title**

**Predicting Internal Credit Ratings for Counterparty Risk Analysis in Commodity Trading**

**Author** - Amit Dongardive

#### **Executive Summary**

This project aims to predict internal credit ratings for counterparties in commodity trading, incorporating both financial metrics and exposure data. Using advanced machine learning models, the project evaluates the risk levels of counterparties to assist in decision-making, ensuring financial stability and mitigating default risks.

#### **Rationale**

Counterparty credit risk is a critical concern in commodity trading due to volatile market conditions and substantial financial exposures. Accurate internal ratings, beyond external credit ratings, provide deeper insights into counterparties' financial health and help businesses mitigate potential losses.

#### **Research Question**

How can internal credit ratings for counterparties be accurately predicted using a combination of financial metrics, exposure data, and machine learning techniques?

#### **Data Sources**

*   **Primary Dataset:** Enriched financial dataset (enriched\_financials\_data.csv), containing financial ratios (from disclosed financial statements), external ratings (from ratings agencies like S&P and Moody's), and exposure metrics for 593 counterparties across multiple quarters.
    
*   **Additional Features:** Internal client specific fields like Current\_Exposure, Long\_Term\_Exposure, and Internal\_Rating.
    

#### **Methodology**

1.  **CRISP-DM Framework:**
    
    *   **Business Understanding:** Identified the importance of internal ratings in managing counterparty risk.
        
    *   **Data Understanding:** Explored the dataset using comprehensive visualizations and missing value analysis.
        
    *   **Data Preparation:** Addressed missing values, engineered features, and normalized the data for machine learning.
        
2.  **Machine Learning Techniques:**
    
    *   Trained and evaluated multiple models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
        
    *   Applied hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation for robustness.
        
3.  **Evaluation Metrics:**
    
    *   Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² metrics.
        

#### **Results**

*   **XGBoost Model:** Achieved the best performance with an R² score of 0.97 and low MSE, indicating high accuracy in predicting internal ratings.
    
*   **Feature Importance:** Key predictors included Debt Ratio, External Rating, and Current Exposure.
    
*   **Visual Insights:** Comprehensive plots highlighted data trends, feature correlations, and model performance comparisons.
    

#### **Next Steps**

*   Expand the dataset with more macroeconomic indicators and longer historical records.
    
*   Explore ensemble techniques (e.g., stacking models) for improved predictions.
    
*   Integrate SHAP or LIME for enhanced interpretability of individual predictions.
    
*   Deploy the model as a real-time risk assessment tool with a user-friendly dashboard.
